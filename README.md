# Random-Password-Generator

## Summary
 My name is Marko Majetic , I am attending the UofT Bootcamp and I have created a random password generator using Javascript, HTML and CSS. This password generator uses prompts that allows a user to determine the preferred password length and which of the following character types to use (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters). I have created a function with javascript that would generate a password based on what criteria have been chosen through prompts.

## Usage

### User
    - To run the application, click on the link in the Link Section
    - You will be directed to the web-page where the password generator is 
    located and you will click on the generate password button to initiate the process
    - You will answer a series of questions regarding what password criteria 
    will be chosen (you must be select at least one criteria, or else an error will 
    appear and the prompts will start all over)
    - The password criteria are the following;
        The desired password length (on the condition that it is between 8 and 128 characters long)
        Whether you want the password to contain uppercase letters
        Whether you want the password to contain lowercase letters
        Whether you want the password to contain numbers
        Whether you want the password to contain special characters
    -Finally, When all the prompts are answered, a password will be generated on the criteria chosen
